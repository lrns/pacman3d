*** Readme for lwjgl_jgds_base ***

Use the build and run batch files to build and run.

Each commands needs the java file to build, or the class file to run given on the command line

The library is the stock library (2.6) from lwjgl.org  The only changes are the addition of the build/run scripts, the Lesson01.java, and slick-util.jar (from http://slick.cokeandcode.com/)

e.g.

*** Windows
build Lesson01
run Lesson01

*** Linux
sh build.sh Lesson01
sh run.sh Lesson01
